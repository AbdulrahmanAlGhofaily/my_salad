On this site, the mirn stack technology was used . the site is selling salads and consists of three types: protein salad, vegetable salad , and fruit salad


The MERN stack (MongoDB Express Angular Node) is one of many variants where React.js is used in place of the conventional Angular.js front-end framework. MEVN (MongoDB, Express, Vue, Node) is another variation, although essentially any front-end JavaScript framework will do.

Are you prepared to move forward? Create a free Atlas account by clicking the link below, then use our MERN Stack Tutorial to quickly build a full-stack MERN application.
The MERN stack consists of four parts. Let's talk about each of them individually. 

•    MongoDB, a NoSQL database management system, is the first element. 
•    ExpressJS is the second element of the MERN stack. It is a framework for NodeJS-based backend web applications.
•    ReactJS, a JavaScript toolkit for creating UIs based on UI components, is the third component. 
•    NodeJS is the last element of the MERN stack. It is a JS runtime environment, allowing JavaScript code to be executed outside of a browser.
Front end using React.js
React.js, a declarative JavaScript framework for building dynamic client-side apps in HTML, makes up the top tier of the MERN stack. React enables you to link simple components to data on your back-end server, connect complicated interfaces to those connections, and render those interfaces as HTML.
React excels at handling stateful, data-driven interfaces with little effort and code, and it includes all the features you'd expect from a contemporary web framework, including excellent support for forms, error handling, events, lists, and more.

Node.js and Express.js server layer
The server-side framework Express.js, which functions inside a Node.js server, is the next level below. Express.js describes itself as a "fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js," and in fact, that is exactly what it is. Express.js offers robust models for handling HTTP requests and responses as well as URL routing (correlating an incoming URL with a server function).
database tier for MongoDB

You'll need a database that's just as simple to use as React, Express, and Node if your application stores any data (user profiles, content, comments, uploads, events, etc.).

MongoDB can help with this because it allows JSON documents created in your React.js front end to be sent to the Express.js server for processing and, if they're valid, direct storage in MongoDB for later retrieval. Once more, if you're building in the cloud, you should consider Atlas. Continue reading if you want to set up your own MERN stack!
